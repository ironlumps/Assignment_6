Assignment #6 - Sorting Algorithms

The files that are being submitted are the Sorting.h file, Sorting.cpp file, the main.cpp that goes with them and a LaTex document that acts as an evaluation for the sorting
algorithms.

The main problems that I ran into are still persistant at the time of turning in the code. Whenever the code hits one of the methods, it hits a segmentation (core dumped) 
error, and with all the research I did to fix the error, I couldn't get the error to be fixed. So the main problem of the code is that it doesn't actually work.

References:
The main references I used was that I took some of the sorting algorithms, quick sort and merge sort, from a few of the websites listed below, and modified them slightly to 
allow for memory allocation or a different datatype or in some other form, but the bulk of those methods are taken from some websites below.
